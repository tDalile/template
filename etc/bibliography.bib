  abstract = {Conformance Checking (CC) techniques enable us to gives the deviation between modelled behavior and actual execution behavior. The majority of organizations have Process-Aware Information Systems for recording the insights of the system. They have the process model to show how the process will be executed. The key intention of Process Mining is to extracting facts from the event log and used them for analysis, ratification, improvement, and redesigning of a process. Researchers have proposed various CC techniques for specific applications and process models. This paper has a detailed study of key concepts and contributions of Process Mining. It also helps in achieving business goals. The current challenges and opportunities in Process Mining are also discussed. The survey is based on CC techniques proposed by researchers with key objectives like quality parameters, perspective, algorithm types, tools, and achievements.},

  abstract = {Process mining techniques can be used to discover, analyze and improve real processes, by extracting models from observed behavior. The aim of this book is conformance checking, one of the main areas of process mining. In conformance checking, existing process models are compared with actual observations of the process in order to assess their quality. Conformance checking techniques are a way to visualize the differences between assumed process represented in the model and the real process in the event log, pinpointing possible problems to address, and the business process management results that rely on these models. This book combines both application and research perspectives. It provides concrete use cases that illustrate the problems addressed by the techniques in the book, but at the same time, it contains complete conceptualization and formalization of the problem and the techniques, and through evaluations on the quality and the performance of the proposed techniques. Hence, this book brings the opportunity for business analysts willing to improve their organization processes, and also data scientists interested on the topic of process-oriented data science},
